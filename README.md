# 🏁 One-Line Positioning

> AgriChain Carbon bridges the gap between small farmers and global carbon markets by converting sustainable agricultural practices into measurable and monetizable climate assets.

---

# 🚨 Problem Statement

Indian farmers contribute significantly to global climate mitigation through soil carbon sequestration and regenerative practices. However, small and marginal farmers are excluded from carbon markets due to:

- Lack of awareness about carbon monetization  
- Absence of carbon measurement tools  
- High verification costs  
- Fragmented land holdings  
- No structured aggregation platform  

Meanwhile, global corporations are actively purchasing carbon credits to meet ESG and Net-Zero commitments.

**This creates a structural disconnect between small-scale carbon producers and global carbon buyers.**

---

# 🎯 Objective

To build a scalable digital platform that:

- Estimates soil carbon sequestration potential  
- Quantifies carbon credit eligibility  
- Aggregates small farmers into viable carbon pools  
- Projects carbon income potential  
- Encourages regenerative agricultural practices  

---

# 🌱 Solution Overview

AgriChain Carbon transforms climate-positive agricultural practices into tradable financial assets.

The platform enables farmers to:

- Measure carbon sequestration potential  
- View real-time carbon credit estimates  
- Improve sustainability score  
- Simulate income projections  
- Participate in aggregated carbon pools  

By digitizing farm-level sustainability metrics, we create structured access to voluntary carbon markets.

# 🧮 MVP – Carbon Credit Engine

## 1️⃣ Carbon Credit Estimator

**Inputs**
- Farm size (hectares)
- Crop type
- Tillage practice
- Fertilizer intensity
- Residue management
- Irrigation type

**Outputs**
- Estimated sequestration (tCO₂e/year)
- Estimated carbon credits
- Projected annual income
- Confidence score

---

## 2️⃣ Sustainability Score (0–100)

Calculated using:

- Soil management practices  
- Crop rotation diversity  
- Chemical input intensity  
- Water efficiency  
- Residue burning avoidance  

Purpose:
- Encourages regenerative practices  
- Enhances climate eligibility  
- Improves soil health awareness  

---

## 3️⃣ Aggregation Model

To address small landholding fragmentation:

- Farmers are digitally pooled  
- Carbon volumes aggregated  
- Minimum issuance thresholds met  
- Cluster-level monetization enabled  

---

## 4️⃣ Income Simulation Model

Farmers can view:

- 1-Year Carbon Income  
- 5-Year Growth Projection  
- Impact of improved practices on income  

This drives financial motivation for sustainable transition.
