# 🏁 One-Line Positioning

> Krishak Saarthi is an AI-powered decision intelligence assistant that helps farmers determine **when to harvest, where to sell, and how to reduce spoilage**, maximizing profitability and sustainability.

---

# 🚨 Problem Statement

Indian farmers lose **30–40% of agricultural produce**, not due to poor farming practices, but because of:

- Poor harvest timing  
- Lack of real-time market intelligence  
- Limited access to mandi price trends  
- Post-harvest spoilage  
- Inefficient storage and transport decisions  

Farmers often depend on informal networks for pricing and harvest decisions, leading to:

- Suboptimal price realization  
- Increased spoilage losses  
- Financial instability  

Currently, there is no unified, farmer-friendly intelligence platform that integrates:

- Real-time weather forecasts  
- Soil health indicators  
- Historical mandi price data  
- Arrival volumes  
- Transport logistics  

---

# 🎯 Objective

To build an **AI-Driven Farm-to-Market Intelligence Platform** that:

- Recommends optimal harvest windows  
- Identifies the most profitable mandi  
- Assesses spoilage risk  
- Suggests preservation strategies  
- Ensures transparency and trust  

Designed specifically for:

- Basic Android devices  
- Low data consumption  
- Simple language interface  
- Visual indicators instead of technical dashboards  

---

# 🌱 Solution Overview

Krishak Saarthi acts as a **digital agricultural decision assistant**.

It combines:

- Weather forecasting models  
- Historical mandi pricing trends  
- Crop maturity timelines  
- Soil and moisture indicators  
- Storage risk modeling  

The platform delivers **actionable, explainable recommendations**, not just predictions.
